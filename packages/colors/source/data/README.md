# Data

❗**Important**:

**Do not edit the content in this directory!**\
It is automatically created with a script during the build process _(`pnpm build`)_.

---

## Purpose

🎯 The purpose of this directory is to:

-   preview,
-   and analyse the content of the created data,

**before** the minification to the distributable directory _(`./dist`)_.

---

## Creation

⚙️ If you want to run a separate process for creating the data only, use the
script:

```sh
pnpm build:data
```
