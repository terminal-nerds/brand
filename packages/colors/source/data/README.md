# Data

‚ùó**Important**:

**Do not edit the content in this directory!**\
It is automatically generated with a script during the build process _(`pnpm build`)_.

---

The purpose of this directory is to:

-   preview,
-   and analyse the content of the generated data,

**before** the minification to the distributable directory _(`./dist`)_.

---

If you want to run a separate process for generating the data only, use the
script:

```sh
pnpm build:data
```
